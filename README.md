## Let's unlock the future, together!

I'm Aabishkar, a **passionate software engineer with 6+ years of experience** building and securing robust applications. My journey has led me to explore the exciting realms of **Software Engineering, DevOps, AI, and cloud security**, where I find immense satisfaction in streamlining workflows, automating tasks, and safeguarding the digital landscape.

I'm fluent in **TypeScript, Python, AWS**, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies. My toolbox is stocked with essential tools like **Node.js, React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, AWS, Redis, Elasticsearch, Jest, Docker, MySQL, Postgres, and serverless technologies.**. When it comes to architecture, I lean towards **microservices, event-driven architectures, and design system patterns**.
