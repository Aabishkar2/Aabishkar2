## Let's get to know each other! 

I'm Aabishkar, a **passionate software engineer** with **5+ years of experience** building and deploying robust applications. I'm particularly fascinated by the **DevOps realm**, where I enjoy streamlining workflows and automating tasks to ensure efficient development and delivery.

I'm fluent in **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, AWS**, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies. My toolbox is stocked with essential tools like **Node.js, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, AWS, Redis, Elasticsearch, Jest, Docker, MySQL, and Postgres**. When it comes to architecture, I lean towards **microservices, event-driven architectures, and design system patterns**.

Beyond code, I'm a **strong advocate for open source** and actively contribute to various projects. I believe in the power of community collaboration and sharing knowledge to push the boundaries of what's possible.
